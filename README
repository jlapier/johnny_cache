JohnnyCache
===========

Allows for a time_to_live option on cached ERB fragments by inserting a timestamp into the HTML.

Current version only tested with Rails 2.3.5.


Example
=======

In a view:

  <% cache("some_fragment", :time_to_live => 5.minutes) do -%>
    This fragment was cached at <%= Time.now.utc.strftime "%H:%M:%S on %m/%d/%Y" %> 
    and will expire at: <%= 5.minutes.from_now.utc.strftime "%H:%M:%S on %m/%d/%Y" %> (UTC)
  <% end %>

Checking the cache in a controller:

  # instead of: read_fragment("some_fragment"), try:
  unless get_johnny_cache("some_fragment")
    # make some expensive DB queries
  end

Remember!
=========

If you want to play with caching and you're working in development mode, you need to enable caching. 
Find the perform_caching line in environments/development.rb and change it to true:

# config/environments/development.rb
config.action_controller.perform_caching             = true


Installation
============
script/plugin install git://github.com/jlapier/johnny_cache.git
