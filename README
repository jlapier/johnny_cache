JohnnyCache
===========

Allows for a time_to_live option on cached ERB fragments by inserting a timestamp into the HTML.


Example
=======

In a view:

  <% cache("some_fragment", :time_to_live => 5.minutes) do -%>
    This fragment was cached at <%= Time.now %> 
    and will expire at: <%= 5.minutes.from_now %>
  <% end %>

Checking the cache in a controller:

  # instead of: read_fragment("some_fragment"), try:
  unless get_johnny_cache("some_fragment")
    # make some expensive DB queries
  end
